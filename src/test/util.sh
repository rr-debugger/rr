# This file is included by foo.run test-driver files.  It provides
# some helpers for common test operations.  A driver file foo.run
# will want to include this file as follows
#
#  source `dirname $0`/util.sh
#
# It is essential that util.sh inherit its $n parameters from the
# driver script's parameters.
#
# Most tests are either "compare_test"s, which check that record and
# replay successfully complete and the output is the same, or,
# "debug_test"s, which launch a debugger script.  So the remainder of
# your test runner probably looks like
#
#  compare_test  # or, |debug_test|
#
# Test runners may set the environment variable $RECORD_ARGS to pass
# arguments to rr for recording.  This is only useful for tweaking the
# scheduler, don't use it for anything else.  Test runners may also
# set $REPLAY_ARGS to pass arguments to rr for replay, allowing the
# use of an alternate GDB, for instance.
