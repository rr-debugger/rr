 * task (because the kernel guarantees those effects are seen by woken-up

 * PTRACE_SYSCALL with clone/fork/vfork and execve. The tracee must run to
 * the ENTERING_SYSCALL_PTRACE state, allow a context switch so the ptracer
 * can modify tracee registers, then perform ENTERING_SYSCALL (which actually
 * creates the new task or does the exec), allow a context switch so the
 * ptracer can modify the new task or post-exec state in a PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC/
 * CLONE/FORK/VFORK, then perform EXITING_SYSCALL to get into the correct
 * post-syscall state.
