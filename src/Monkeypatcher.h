 *
 * 1) Patch the VDSO's user-space-only implementation of certain system calls
 * (e.g. gettimeofday) to do a proper kernel system call instead, so rr can
 * trap and record it (x86-64 only).
 *
 * 2) Patch the VDSO __kernel_vsyscall fast-system-call stub to redirect to
 * our syscall hook in the preload library (x86 only).
 *
 * 3) Patch syscall instructions whose following instructions match a known
 * pattern to call the syscall hook.
 *
 * Monkeypatcher only runs during recording, never replay.
