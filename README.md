# Overview

rr is a lightweight tool for recording, replaying and debugging execution of applications (trees of processes and threads).
Debugging extends gdb with very efficient reverse-execution, which in combination with standard gdb/x86 features like hardware data watchpoints, makes debugging much more fun. More information about the project, including instructions on how to install, run, and build rr, is at [https://rr-project.org](https://rr-project.org). The best technical overview is currently the paper [Engineering Record And Replay For Deployability: Extended Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05937.pdf).

# System requirements

* Linux kernel â‰¥ 3.11 is required (for `PTRACE_SETSIGMASK`).
* rr currently requires either:
  * An Intel CPU with [Nehalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_%28microarchitecture%29) (2010) or later microarchitecture.
  * Certain AMD Zen or later processors (see https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/wiki/Zen)
* Running in a VM guest is supported, as long as the VM supports virtualization of hardware performance counters. (VMware and KVM are known to work; Xen does not.)
